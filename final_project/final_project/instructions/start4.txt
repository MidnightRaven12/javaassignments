There are many ways to use this software, such as tinkering with it in order to advance your own knowledge.

Additionally, there are some technical things, such as the usage of a GUI, as well as some basic game logic and many more.

Lastly, the actual intended usage is either an Aim trainer disguised as a Whack-A-Mole game.

Again, use this however you want. There's instructions on how to build the Project in the notes folder, so tinker to your heart's content.
