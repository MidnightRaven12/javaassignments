# Whack-A-Mole

As it turns out, there is demand in the United States of America for adequate aim training. And so, I repurposed my game instead of clicking, I chose Whack A Mole.

It's a real tragedy. Many young kids are not getting the adequate aim training that they need to survive in today's ever changing lifestyle. Before, it was just video games. Nowadays, it's also building, as well as being able to play multiple games at once, such as Minecraft, or Fortnite. It's a real shame that many kids will fall behind their peers. 

Gaming is an essential skill. And we need to do something about it.

# What it is: 

Basically, there's just a few powerups, and an instructions manual, and that's it. It's just aiming, and clicking as fast as you can with four varying difficulties. 

# Technical Capabilities

The technical capabilities consist of being able to run a GUI, and being able to use Powershell, and Bash scripting in order to help with compatibility. Also, we can, use `.git`, and can commit to a GitHub repo, I guess. Lastly, we also know how to use VSCode.


# Compiling 

These are the requirements:

1. Java 11 or Higher
2. JavaFX SDK (version 11 or higher)

So, some more notes on how to compile this:

1. `git clone`, you know what the drill is, hopefully.
2. Use `scripts/compile.ps1`, or `scripts/compile.sh` in order to compile and run the game locally. 
3. Either play the game, or change it in your own way.
