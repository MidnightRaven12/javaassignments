# Basic Facts about the Project

We will build a game in which a user clicks a button, and the goal is to simply get as high of a score as you can. Turns out, this is really, really good for Aim Training, a thing in which you move your mouse in games in order to get to a certain position as fast as you can. 

It will be useful for entertainment, as well as for my own educational benefit as to using JavaFX. 

## More Technical Facts: 

It will just be a basic Whack A Mole Game, just to use JavaFX for fun. The idea is just to experiment with some powerups, and spice up some basic applications with a GUI.
