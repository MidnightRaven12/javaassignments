# 2,000 Clicks

## By: Brandon C.

# Basic Facts about the Project

We will build a game in which a user clicks a button, and the goal is to simply get 2000 clicks. However, the issue is that it gets progressively harder over time, with more obstacles, and more things to stop you along the way. The button will seemingly fight back, until you reach 2000. 

It will be useful for entertainment, as well as for my own educational benefit as to using JavaFX. 

I'm also planning to use this as a CTF. Naturally, there is going to be a hidden flag somewhere, and some intentionally insecure code, with a side of Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities. 

## More Technical Facts:

1. It will have a save feature, that will use a hashing function in order to prevent tampering of the game. (of course, since the code is open source, and anyone can modify it, this point is useless to bring up.)

2. Spoiler Alert, it will have something to do with the hashing function and how to reverse engineer it to give you what it wants. Then, you will be able to run whatever code that you want.

3. We will also have a database in order to race your friends to 2000 clicks, using some more Java in order for people to host their own LAN games. 

# Summary

Basically, a network component, as well as a front end component, with a little CTF flavor added to it.
