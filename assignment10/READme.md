(Basically, the same thing as 9, but with *generic types*. Yeah.)

Also, `demo.java` in the `.gitignore` file is a lot of rough work and rough ideas that I keep. 

Generic types are really overpowered, in the sense that you won't have to worry about types, especially when returning different functions.

For instance, let's say that you have some function that prints out numbers from an array, say with an intput of `int[]`. But let's say that you have an array of strings, like `String[]`. Then, you would have to define another function explicitly for handling strings. 

Well, fear no more! Generics allow you to do that with a simple function. Just use `<T>`, and you'll be free. (also, `E`, `K`, or `V`, but you get the point.) Anyways, just please run the code.
